##  My Contributions

This project was inspired by an open-source concept. I have:

-  Built reusable components for symptom input and results
-  Integrated **Flask and Express.js** in the backend for handling predictions
-  Created user-friendly UI/UX with proper routing
-  Implemented local storage to save medical reports
-  Deployed the project with working domain (live link below)
-  Added proper project structure and `README.md` for clarity
